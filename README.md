MiniSocial - Social Networking Application
🚀 Project Description
MiniSocial is a lightweight social networking application designed to enhance social interactions in a collaborative environment. The application allows users to connect, share ideas, and create engaging content. Users can register, maintain profiles, post updates, and send friend requests. The framework is built using a clean, modular Java EE architecture, utilizing:

EJBs for business logic

JPA for persistence

JTA for transaction management

JAX-RS for RESTful APIs

JAAS for role-based security

JMS for asynchronous messaging and notifications

🌟 Core Features
1. User Management [10 Points] 📄
User Registration: Users can register for an account with a valid email address and password.

User Login: Users can authenticate themselves and log in to access the application.

Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, including their name, bio, email, and password. During profile creation, users can choose a role (user or admin).

2. Connection Management (Social Networking Feature) [30 Points] 👥
Friend Requests: Users can send and receive friend requests to connect with other users.

Manage Connections: Users can accept or reject pending friend requests.

View Connections: Users can view all their friends and their profiles.

3. Post Management [40 Points] 📝
Create Posts: Users can create status updates to share with their friends, including attaching images or links.

Feed Retrieval: Users can view a timeline feed that shows their posts and those of their friends.

Edit Posts: Users can update or delete a pre-posted post.

Engagement: Users can like and comment on posts made by friends, facilitating interaction.

4. Groups Management [40 Points] 👥
Create a Group [5 Points]: Any user can create a new group (e.g., "Java Enthusiasts", "Book Club").

A group has: Name, Description, Creator (Group Admin), and List of members.

A group can be open or closed (requires admin permission to join).

Join & Leave Groups [15 Points]: Users can request to join a group (pending approval), or join directly if it’s open.

Admins can approve or reject membership requests.

Notifications are sent via JMS when a member joins or gets approved.

Post in Group [10 Points]: Members can create group-specific posts. Posts are visible only to other members of that group.

Group Roles & Permissions [10 Points]:

Group creator becomes the Group Admin.

Admin can promote users to be admins, remove posts or users from the group, and delete the group.

Role-based logic is enforced with JAAS or custom EJB checks.

5. Messaging Module - Notifications via JMS [15 Points] 📬
Real-Time Notifications:

Users receive notifications for events such as:

When a friend request is received.

When a friend likes or comments on their posts.

When a comment is made on their posts.

When joining or leaving a group.

Event Object: A standardized event object is created to accommodate various event types (like notifications).

Verification involves utilizing a message-driven bean or publish/consumer models to print the received event.

6. Authentication and Security [15 Points] 🔐
Role-Based Access Control:

Admin Role: Full access for user and content management. Only admins can apply CRUD operations to users' posts and check group admin permissions.

Regular User Role: Limited access to create posts, manage friends, and view timelines.

Access Restrictions:

API endpoints for user management and admin functionalities are restricted to users with the Admin role. Unauthorized access attempts lead to a 403 Forbidden error.

🎯 Bonus Features (Optional)
Media Attachments [2 Points] 📸

Allow users to post with image URLs.

User Search & Friend Suggestions [5 Points] 🔍

Users can search other users by name or email.

Suggest friends based on mutual connections.

Activity Log [5 Points] 🧾

Show a log of recent actions (posts, likes, friend additions).

Use JMS to queue and store logs asynchronously.

🔧 Tech Stack Overview
JPA: Manage data entities such as User, Post, FriendRequest, and Group.

EJBs: Stateless beans that handle various services (e.g., UserService, PostService, GroupService).

JAX-RS: RESTful APIs for interaction with the client-side application.

JTA: Ensures data integrity through transaction management.

JAAS: Security layer for user authentication and role management.

JMS: Messaging system to handle notifications and asynchronous events.
